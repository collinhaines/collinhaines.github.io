    <p>This has been the worst project I&rsquo;ve ever worked on.</p>

<p>I purchased this domain when I was 16 years old and nearly 8 years later, I have not delivered a satisfying product to the client.</p>

<p>This website has changed countless times. The first iteration I can remember involved a number of images in place of what CSS could have easily handled. The second iteration involved having a <em>separate</em> image that would display when the user hovered over the navigation (thanks <code>onmouseover</code>) thereby having users download at least two separate images for each navigation item. Not to mention that the images had the text <strong>within</strong> the image, not written by the browser.</p>

<p>But it got better. Slightly.</p>

<p>My first job in this industry had me upgrading their website from a logo-only website to a pseudo business-card website. After a combination of <code>&lt;table&gt;</code> and <code>&lt;center&gt;</code> tags the site had content! It wasn&rsquo;t half-bad for an in-house creation and a part-time summer job. But let&rsquo;s be realistic. It was horrible. That site launched four months before HTML5 had its initial release in October 2014.</p>

<p>But it got better. Slightly.</p>

<p>Shortly thereafter, I discovered Bootstrap 3. Quickly discovering that there are libraries, projects, and frameworks that people graciously create (and release for free) that make our lives easier. This whole world was new. I was never taught this in college. I was taught to do it myself. To understand the basics. Which is understandable, but annoying. Into the world of Bootstrap this website became!</p>

<p>So it got better. Slightly.</p>

<p>Four solid years and countless iterations using Bootstrap, this website embraced, endured, and enabled its new changes. Some had professionalism. Some had wit. Some had both. Hell, one was just a contact form.</p>

<p>But it got better. Slightly.</p>

<p>Now it&rsquo;s just a blog site. Will it continue to be? Probably. It&rsquo;s <em>really easy</em> to maintain updates on this.</p>

<p>But will it get better?</p>
