      <description>This has been the worst project I&amp;rsquo;ve ever worked on.
I purchased this domain when I was 16 years old and nearly 8 years later, I have not delivered a satisfying product to the client.
This website has changed countless times. The first iteration I can remember involved a number of images in place of what CSS could have easily handled. The second iteration involved having a separate image that would display when the user hovered over the navigation (thanks onmouseover) thereby having users download at least two separate images for each navigation item.</description>
